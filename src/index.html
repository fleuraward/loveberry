<h2 class="grad italics">A Berry Small Site</h2>
<p>Hello hello and welcome to the humble little website, loveberry! This is a site functioning as a resource page that I've largely crafted with my own two paws! Forever a work in progress... This is as much as a resource webpage for myself as it is for the many many visitors here! some are stuff I've found from numerous places as well as some of my own codes I've pieced together. Feel free to link my site button in any resource masterlists! </p>

<h3 class="grad italics">Why Loveberry?</h3>
<p>Loveberry as a name was chosen because it sounded cute, unfortunately no fun origin story for it here. The actual site was created mainly because I wanted to try and make my own resources (or at least, style some css for public use) in a snippets like fashion that I've seen popular throughout, mainly carrd related, spaces. I aim to make some coded things to be more accessible, and for people to look through snippets here and perhaps learn how things were done through analysing the code!</p>

<h4 class="grad italics">More About the Creator</h4>
<p>I'm June! I run <a href="https://layercake.nekoweb.org" class="outbound">Layercake</a>, which is my own personal website that I put my opinion and stuff on sometimes. I've had my website up since the backend of 2022 (according to my former neocities profile), but I started getting super passionate about maintaining my website from 2023 onwards. Layercake is my main focus, with Loveberry being more of a side project. If you enjoy my work on loveberry you can add my buttons and link me to your page!</p>
